        <h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
        <p>The capstone seminar in the Master of Public Administration program
        at Cal State Fullerton examines concepts, models, and ideologies of
        public administration within the larger political system.</p>
        <h1 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h1>
        <p>This course is designed to accomplish five interrelated
        objectives.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p><strong>Theory Examination</strong>: We will delve into the most
        important theories and literature in public administration, fostering a
        deep understanding of the field.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Literature Review</strong>: You will complete a
        literature review in your concentration area, allowing you to specialize
        and delve deeper into a specific aspect of public administration. This
        preparation will be crucial for the general concentration portion of the
        comprehensive exams.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Writing Skills</strong>: This course will enhance your
        writing skills, focusing on clear, concise, and effective communication.
        This preparation will be crucial for the general theory portion of the
        comprehensive exams.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Peer Review and Collaboration</strong>: Through a
        structured peer review process, you will learn to provide constructive
        feedback, gain new perspectives, and improve your own work based on your
        peers’ insights. This collaborative learning approach is designed to
        mimic real-world public administration environments where collaboration
        and feedback are key.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>AI-Assisted Learning</strong>: We will be incorporating

        <h3 id="there-are-four-required-books-for-this-course.">There are four
        required books for this course.</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Denhardt and Denhardt (2015) develop a framework emphasizing the
        importance of public service values, democratic engagement, and
        collaboration between citizens and government. The authors argue that
        the New Public Service (NPS) is a departure from the traditional public
        administration model, which prioritizes efficiency and effectiveness,
        and instead emphasizes the public interest, social equity, and the need
        for public servants to engage with citizens and communities. The NPS
        emphasizes that public service is a calling and requires a commitment to
        serving the public good above personal gain or profit. The framework has
        implications for how public organizations are structured, how they
        engage with citizens, and how they are held accountable for their
        actions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gooden (2014) explores the historical and contemporary challenges
        surrounding race and social equity within public administration. The
        book highlights the importance of addressing racial disparities in
        policy outcomes and emphasizes the critical role of public
        administrators in promoting social equity. Through a comprehensive
        analysis of the intersection between race and public policy, Gooden
        offers practical strategies and best practices for fostering a diverse
        and inclusive public service workforce. This essential resource equips
        students and practitioners with the knowledge and tools necessary to
        confront racial disparities and work towards a more equitable society in
        their roles as public administrators.</p></li>
        <li><p>Kamarck (2007) posits that the traditional bureaucratic model of
        government is evolving into a more efficient and responsive system due
        to the transformative power of technology and globalization. She
        contends that this shift is characterized by the rise of networked
        governance, in which governments increasingly collaborate with private
        and non-governmental organizations to deliver public services and by
        adopting performance-based management techniques. While challenging the
        status quo, Kamarck argues that these changes enhance governments’
        capacity to address complex social and economic issues, providing
        citizens with more effective and accountable institutions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lipsky (2010) focuses on the role of front-line public service
        workers, or “street-level bureaucrats,” who directly interact with the
        public and implement policies. He explores the dilemmas these workers
        face, such as limited resources, conflicting goals, and the need to
        exercise discretion in decision-making. The book relates to public
        administration by illuminating the importance of understanding the
        experiences and challenges faced by street-level bureaucrats, as their
        actions determine the success or failure of public policies.</p></li>

        <h2 id="weekly-essays-and-peer-review">1. Weekly Essays and Peer
        Review</h2>
        <p>To facilitate class discussion and prepare you for comprehensive
        exams, your weekly writing assignment begins with an annotated
        bibliography of each weekly reading. It concludes with a 1–2-page
        synthesis of the week’s readings. This assignment incorporates a group
        activity, use of an AI large language model (e.g., ChatGPT) and
        individual work.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Citation is required at the top of each bibliographic entry
        (refer to the citation guide at the end), and each entry should include
        a summary highlighting the central theme and important points of the
        reading. Each bibliographic entry should be approximately one
        paragraph.</p></li>
        <li><p>The synthesis focuses on the lessons/implications of all the
        week’s readings for the theory and practice of PA (i.e., what do these
        works, taken together, tell us about the study and practice of public
        administration?).</p></li>

        <h3 id="details">Details</h3>
        <p>We’ll be incorporating AI (ChatGPT) in our weekly assignments to

        behind this and how to interact with ChatGPT, and you’ll have a chance
        to practice using it. While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for learning,
        remember that it’s meant to complement, not replace, your own critical
        thinking and learning process.</p></li>
        <li><p>Please make sure to be as specific and detailed as possible when
        talking with ChatGPT. The more information you provide, the more

        <h3 id="iterative-annotated-bibliographies-and-syntheses">Iterative
        Annotated Bibliographies and Syntheses</h3>
        <h4 id="annotated-bibliographies">Annotated Bibliographies:</h4>
        <p>An annotated bibliography is an organized list of sources (like a
        reference list), where each source is followed by a brief (usually about
        150 words) descriptive and evaluative paragraph—the annotation. In this
        course, each annotation should consist of a citation, a summary of the
        central theme and key points of the source, and a note on its relevance
        to the week’s topic.</p>
        <p>The annotated bibliography in this course is to review the literature
        on the week’s topic and prepare you for in-depth discussion and
        analysis. It also helps develop your ability to distill and synthesize
        complex information, a key skill in public administration.</p>
        <h4 id="syntheses">Syntheses:</h4>
        <p>A synthesis is a piece of writing that combines information from many
        sources to present an understanding or make a point. The sources used in
        a synthesis may be different articles, essays, interviews, or lectures.
        In this case, your sources are the readings for the week.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the synthesis in this course is to pull together the
        main themes and insights from the week’s readings and discuss their
        implications for public administration. The synthesis should not be a
        simple summary of each source, but rather a critical analysis that
        identifies patterns draws connections, and addresses contradictions
        among the sources. The synthesis encourages you to think critically and
        analytically about the readings and their implications for the theory
        and practice of public administration.</p>
        <p>Remember that both the annotated bibliography and synthesis are
        iterative processes, where feedback from peers, the AI, and your
        reflection will be used to refine and improve your work.</p>
        <h3 id="the-process">The Process:</h3>
        <h4 id="annotated-bibliographies-1">Annotated Bibliographies:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Weeks 2 and 3:
        <ul>
        <li>Draft an annotated bibliography for each of the weeks’ readings, and
        then share it with your group. The group collectively discusses each
        bibliography and gives feedback. This could be done in Canvas or a
        GoogleDoc. Following group discussions, you will revise your annotated
        bibliography accordingly and share it with the AI (ChatGPT) for further
        feedback. This prompt might look something like: <em>“I’ve completed an
        annotated bibliography for an article. The citation is [insert
        citation]. The summary I wrote is [insert summary]. I’ve noted the
        relevance as [insert relevance]. Could you provide feedback on my
        summary and relevance note?”</em> Make a second revision of your
        annotated bibliography incorporating feedback from the AI.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>The remainder of the Term:
        <ul>
        <li>Draft an annotated bibliography for each of the weeks’ readings, and
        then share it with your group. The group collectively discusses each
        bibliography and gives feedback. This could be done in Canvas or a
        GoogleDoc. Following group discussions, you will revise your annotated
        bibliography accordingly.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="synthesis">Synthesis: </h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Based on the feedback received from your peers and the AI on the
        annotated bibliography, you will draft a synthesis and share it with
        your group for a group review discussion.</p></li>
        <li><p>For each group member, write a brief (no more than one page)
        professional review suggesting improvements in content, connections that
        could be strengthened, etc. After completing this review, you’ll use a
        structured prompt to get feedback from ChatGPT. For example: <em>“I’ve
        reviewed a classmate’s synthesis on [topic]. Here are my main comments
        and suggestions [insert comments and suggestions]. Could you provide
        feedback on the completeness and depth of my review?”</em></p></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Share your reviews and the AI’s feedback with your group as a second
        round of peer review.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="final-submission">Final Submission: </h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Incorporate feedback from the second round of feedback and
        redraft your synthesis. You’ll then use a structured prompt to get
        feedback from ChatGPT. For example: <em>“I’ve synthesized the
        information from [number] articles on [topic]. Here’s my initial draft
        of the synthesis [insert draft]. Could you provide feedback and suggest
        any connections or contrasts I missed?”</em> <strong>You will submit 1)
        your draft and 2) the feedback from ChatGPT on your draft.</strong> You
        do not need to rewrite your synthesis based on feedback from the AI;
        instead, use this opportunity to learn about your writing. (In a
        real-world setting, you would do a final synthesis draft.)</p></li>

        <ul>
        <li>Weeks 2 and 3:
        <ul>
        <li>Once your synthesis is completed, you will write a brief reflection
        on the entire process, your insights, and how the feedback from peers
        and the AI helped shape your synthesis. Reflect on your learning process
        - how your understanding of the readings evolved, which feedback was
        most helpful, and how your thought process changed over time. The
        reflection is then shared with the AI for feedback. For example:
        <em>“I’ve written a reflection on [topic or assignment]. Here’s what I
        wrote [insert reflection]. Could you provide feedback or ask questions
        to provoke further thought?”</em> <strong>Submit your reflection and the
        feedback from ChatGPT to Canvas before Thursday’s class.</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>The remainder of the Term:
        <ul>
        <li>Feel free to continue formally doing the reflections independently,
        but no written submission is required. In class discussion, we will
        continue the reflection process more informally.</li>

        <h3 id="deadlines-for-submission-to-canvas">Deadlines for Submission to

        <ul>
        <li><strong>(Suggest) Monday</strong>: Share annotated
        bibliography.</li>
        <li><strong>(Suggest) Tuesday</strong>: Conduct peer reviews within the

        </ul>
        <h3 id="bye-week">Bye Week:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Every student takes <strong>one</strong> bye week, during which
        they may choose to skip either the annotated bibliography and synthesis,
        the peer review, or both. However, it’s important to note that the peer
        review and annotated bibliography and synthesis don’t have to be skipped
        simultaneously. You can take your bye week for each component at
        separate times in the semester.</p></li>
        <li><p>Regardless of when you choose to take your bye week, you will
        still be assigned a group in Canvas for that week.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you plan to use your bye week for the peer review, it’s
        crucial to inform your group members in advance so they can adjust their
        expectations accordingly.</p></li>
        <li><p>This means that out of the eleven total assignments, you will
        only be graded for a total of ten.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="options-for-bye-week">Options for Bye Week:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Skip peer review and individual annotated
        bibliographies and syntheses simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Skip only the peer review. (Remember to
        inform your group!)</li>
        <li><strong>Option 3:</strong> Skip only the individual annotated
        bibliographies and syntheses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, the bye week is an option to provide flexibility in case of
        unforeseen circumstances or an overwhelming workload, not an
        encouragement to disengage from the course. Keeping up with the readings
        and participating in class discussions is still crucial.</p>
        <h2 id="book-reports">2. Book Reports</h2>
        <p>This semester, you will write three book reports, each contributing
        15% to your course grade. The book report is another opportunity to
        apply and hone the skills you are developing through the AI-assisted
        peer review, synthesis, and annotated bibliographies for the weekly
        readings. Here are some guidelines to help you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Each report should be limited to twelve pages, using double-space
        and 12-point Times New Roman (or equivalent) font. Be sure to include
        page numbers. (I care less about the font than the identical nature of
        the word counts with these limits.)</li>
        <li>Organize your report by chapter. For each chapter, write a brief
        annotated bibliography, focusing on summarizing the main arguments,
        theories, and concepts, just as you do in your weekly assignments.</li>
        <li>Concisely summarize each chapter; avoid superficially skimming
        through each chapter.</li>
        <li>Focus on summarizing the most essential points for each chapter, by
        chapter, and avoid disconnected sentences or bullet points.</li>
        <li>After summarizing each chapter, synthesize the entire book in the
        final 1.5–2 pages. This synthesis should highlight the main arguments
        and theories of the book, discuss its implications for the theory and
        practice of Public Administration (PA), and explain why this work is
        essential to the field or your area of the field. This is like the
        weekly synthesis assignment.</li>
        <li>Properly cite each chapter in your book report.</li>
        <li>Upload your reports to Canvas by the deadline; late reports will not
        be accepted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="book-report-discussion-boards">Book Report Discussion
        Boards</h3>
        <p>We will use online Discussion Boards for book report discussions to
        encourage peer engagement and collaborative learning. Each book has its
        own Discussion Board (DB) with several prompts for you to address. This
        is another chance to hone and refine the peer-review skills you learn
        and use in your weekly reading assignments. Here’s how to
        participate:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Upload your book report by the due date and time (11:59 <span
        class="smallcaps">pm</span>)</li>
        <li>Address at least two prompts in the DB, providing thoughtful
        responses that encourage discussion.</li>
        <li>Respond to at least one other student’s comments (can be on any
        prompt) using a peer review approach like what you practice in the
        weekly assignments.</li>
        <li>Upload your comments to the DB by Friday of each week (also at 11:59
        <span class="smallcaps">pm</span>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The discussion board is a virtual platform where you can share your
        thoughts about the book, engage with your peers, and deepen your
        understanding of the material. Avoid quoting directly from the book or
        your report, as it may affect your grade.</p>
        <h2 id="literature-review">3. Literature Review</h2>
        <p>Your final assignment is a literature review on a topic related to
        your concentration area. This should be approximately ten double-spaced
        pages with 12-point Times New Roman (or equivalent) font. The instructor
        must approve your topic by October 5<sup>th</sup>.</p>
        <p>A literature review is a comprehensive survey of existing research
        related to a specific question or topic. Unlike the conventional
        literature review, you are not required to propose a new research
        question for this assignment. Instead, you will review the literature on
        a preexisting question or topic.</p>
        <h2 id="the-process-1">The Process</h2>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p><strong>Selecting the topic</strong>: Choose a critical, focused,
        and related topic for your concentration area. The scope of the topic
        should be manageable within the two months allocated for this
        task.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Annotated Bibliographies</strong>: Like your weekly
        assignments, you will create annotated bibliographies for each of the
        critical pieces of literature related to your topic. This will help you
        summarize and note the relevance of each work, giving you a solid
        foundation for the literature review. This is for you and will not be
        turned in for a grade.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Synthesis</strong>: Based on your annotated
        bibliographies, create a synthesis that weaves the main arguments,
        theories, or findings from the literature. This synthesis will provide
        the foundation for the body of your literature review. This is for you
        and will not be turned in for a grade.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Structure</strong>: Organize your literature review into
        distinct sections and use headings and subheadings as appropriate:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Introduction: Clearly state your topic and briefly outline your
        literature review.</li>
        <li>Body: Review and discuss the literature you’ve selected, using your
        synthesis as a guide. Organize your discussion according to publication
        chronology, approaches, methods, or theories.</li>
        <li>Conclusion: Discuss the findings of the literature review. What do
        we know, and where is the field on this topic?</li>
        <li>Bibliography</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="additional-parameters">Additional Parameters </h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Your literature review should discuss the field’s evolution on
        the chosen topic, from its origins to its current state, including the
        most influential works in between.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discuss whether this is an issue/question/topic with coherent
        theories, approaches, and models or if it is a disjointed, contentious
        field. You may find some early literature is discredited by later
        research.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remember, this paper is significantly longer than your weekly
        annotated bibliographies, so it’s a chance to delve deeper into the
        details of the various approaches, methods, and theories you’ve
        reviewed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Your review should be written and free of grammatical/spelling
        errors.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="literature-review-deadline">Literature Review Deadline</h2>
        <p>Your literature review is due on Thursday, December 14th by 11:59
        <span class="smallcaps">pm</span>. No late work will be accepted.</p>
        <h2 id="literature-review-executive-summary">Literature Review Executive
        Summary</h2>
        <p>In addition to the literature review, each student will prepare an
        executive summary to share with students in your concentration. The
        executive summary should be double-spaced and two pages long and should
        include the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your topic</li>
        <li>Main findings</li>
        <li>Conclusion</li>
        <li>Bibliography</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="grades">Grades</h1>
        <p>Your work in this class will be graded based on four criteria:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Thoroughly complete each assignment, address all questions, and
        participate in class discussions.</li>
        <li>Effective use of class materials (and other literature while
        researching your literature review topic).</li>
        <li>Sophisticated substantive content and discussion rather than
        superficial.</li>
        <li>Writing at the graduate level, including proper mechanics, grammar,
        syntax, and citation style.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please note that you must complete all assignments to receive a
        passing grade. Grades will not be curved.</p>
