# mainweb

This is my personal webpage. I am trying to get better at coding, and using the template html, css, and bootstrap has been a fun experiment.

I have several other projects i'm working on building my own pages from the ground up. They don't look nearly as good as this one, if one can say it looks "good." That's probably a far reach.

Feel free to give me some suggestions.

Thanks!
